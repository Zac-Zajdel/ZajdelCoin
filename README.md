# Relevant information regarding ZajdelCoin's functonality: 

### What is ZajdelCoin and how does it work?

ZajdelCoin is list of blocks where each block represents a unit of storage for data. The list is called a chain because each block references the block before it, creating (chain) links between between blocks. Each block stores a transaction.

### What is the concept of mining blocks?

Mining blocks refers to the process of running a computationally expensive algorithm in order to create new blocks for the blockchain.

### What is the genesis block?

The genesis block is the first block created in ZajdelCoin. Since all blocks must reference the block that came before it, the genesis block serves as a hardcoded starter block for the chain.

### What is the hash value created on every single block?

The hash value is generated by an algorithm that generates a unique output for every unique output. In the case of this project, we're using the sha-256 algorithm, which produces a unique 256 character hash in binary, and a 64 character hash in hexadecimal.

### What is the Proof of Work concept found in cryptocurrencies?

Proof of work is a mechanism that requires miners to solve a computational puzzle in order to create valid blocks. Solving the puzzle requires a brute-force algorithm that demands CPU power.

### What is the requirement for finding a valid block to add to the chain?

The leading 0's requirement is the standard proof of work implementation for finding valid blocks. By adjusting a nonce value in the block, the miner has an infinite number of tries at generating new hashes. Once the miner finds a hash with a matching number of leading 0's as the block difficulty, the fields for valid new block have been found.

### How difficult is it to obtain a valid block to be added to the chain?

Dynamic difficulty is a mechanism that increases or decreases the difficulty of the next block based on how long it's taking to mine the new block. If the time is exceeding an established mining rate for the system, the difficulty decreases. Likewise, if the time is still before the mine rate, the difficulty increases. This allows ZajdelCoin to control the rate at which blocks are added.

### How does ZajdelCoin ensure that a chain is valid?

Chain validation is the process of ensuring that the data of an external chain is formatted correctly. For the chain to be valid, there are multiple rules to enforce. For starters, every block must be valid, with a proper hash based on the block fields, correctly adjusted difficulty, acceptable number of leading 0's in the hash for the proof of work requirement, and more. Likewise, the chain itself must start with the genesis block, and every block's last hash must reference the hash of the block that came before it.

### What is implemented to ensure the chain being replaced is valid?

Chain replacement is the process of substituting the current chain data for the data of an incoming chain. If the incoming chain is longer, and valid, then it should replace the current chain. This will allow a valid chain, with new blocks, to spread across the eventual ZajdelCoin network, becoming the true chain that all nodes in the ZajdelCoin network agree upon.
